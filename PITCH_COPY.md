# Property CRM - Complete Pitch Package

## 📝 Power Punch Version (200 words)

**Stop Losing Money to Chaos. Start Managing Like a Pro.**

South African landlords and Airbnb hosts are drowning in WhatsApp messages, Excel chaos, and missed rent payments. Every month, thousands of Rands slip through the cracks because you're managing properties with tools built for 1995.

Property CRM changes everything.

**Prevent double-bookings** that destroy your Airbnb ratings. **Never chase rent** again with automated reminders. **Stop juggling** ten different apps—everything in one professional dashboard.

Built specifically for South Africa. Rand currency. POPIA compliant. Works on SA internet speeds. Support team that actually understands your market.

**Real results:** 90% on-time rent payments. Zero double-bookings. 13 hours saved every week. Landlords are scaling from 5 properties to 20+ because they can finally handle the workload.

Start your free 14-day trial. No credit card. Setup takes 5 minutes. If you manage more than 2 properties, this will pay for itself in the first month.

Stop working harder. Start working smarter.
